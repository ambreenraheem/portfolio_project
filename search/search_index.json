Alongside this, I am deeply passionate about machine learning and deep learning, fields that continuously reshape the way we interpret and leverage data. I find immense excitement in understanding these domains and working with their groundbreaking libraries such as: scikit-learn for classical ML models TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning architectures Keras for rapid prototyping These libraries not only simplify the implementation of complex algorithms but also empower experimentation at scale, bridging the gap between theory and real-world application. As I dive deeper into data, my interest naturally evolved into the broader field of data science , where every dataset tells a story, every anomaly sparks curiosity, and every insight can drive meaningful change.

I dedicated 15 years of my life to teaching with complete passion and commitment. Alongside my school job, I also ran home-based coaching classes, where my students achieved excellent results. Now that I\u2019ve stepped into the field of data analysis, I bring the same dedication and consistency. For the past 4 years, I\u2019ve been working hard with focus and determination, continuously updating and upgrading my skills to stay relevant and effective in this evolving field. My turning point came during the COVID-19 pandemic: During the COVID-19 pandemic, I paused teaching and joined Nishat Welfare Organization (NWO) as a Data Entry Specialist . That six-month opportunity became the foundation of my data journey. \ud83d\ude80 It was during this time that Mr. Pir Muhammad Sadiq , Patron-in-Chief of Nishat Welfare Organization (NWO) , highlighted the organization\u2019s need for data professionals. Inspired, I began exploring the field of data science . With strong mentorship from Dr. Kashif Hussain PhD in Machine Learning & Data Mining | AI/ML Researcher & Educator | AdvanceHE Fellow | UK Global Talent | BCS & ACM Member (a lecturer at Solent University, Southampton, UK) (LinkedIn) , and from TS Dr. Noureen Talpur Lecturer / Professional Technologist / Researcher (Machine Learning & Data Science)(a lecturer in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia) (LinkedIn) , I followed a structured 6-month roadmap \u2014 which laid the groundwork for my new career. This is the PDF of the Roadmap that I had followed and still working on it: Open PDF Roadmap \ud83d\udcda To further strengthen my skills, I joined top learning platforms including: I strongly recommend these platforms for anyone looking to enhance their skills, as they consistently offer updated and comprehensive information. And in 2024 , I enrolled in a (ONE YEAR) Postgraduate Diploma (2024-2025) in Data Science with Artificial Intelligence at NED Academy (Nadirshaw Edulji Dinshaw University Of ENGINNEERING & TECHNOLOGY, Karachi) . During this diploma, I gained hands-on expertise in: - Python for Data Science - Business Intelligence - Machine Learning - Deep Learning - Generative AI Working with expert instructors and real-world datasets helped transform my passion into professional expertise. And here, I got the opportunity to work with Crux International Canada and to deepen my understanding of Business Intelligence . Crux International Canada provides emerging talent and dedicated data analysts with valuable opportunities to grow and actively guides them throughout their projects. \ud83d\udcbc Today, I work with Nishat Welfare Organization as a Data Analyst and also offer my services as a freelancer on Upwork . Transitioning into the field of data analysis has been a rewarding experience. Coming from a teaching background, I brought with me strong communication, problem-solving, and analytical thinking skills \u2014 all of which have proven valuable in this new role. The journey wasn\u2019t easy, but with continuous learning and hands-on practice over the last four years, I\u2019ve successfully built a strong foundation as a data analyst. \ud83c\udf0d My Mission My mission is to work with diverse datasets from around the world, continuously learn, and contribute valuable insights that support growth and innovation across global organizations. I am particularly passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning , and I take pride in understanding and applying powerful libraries such as scikit-learn , TensorFlow , PyTorch , and Keras . These tools have enabled me to design intelligent models that go beyond basic analytics \u2014 unlocking predictive power and automation. Currently, I\u2019m working diligently on YOLO (You Only Look Once) , one of the most revolutionary models in the field of deep learning for real-time object detection.
